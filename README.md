# Weather-Plus
The .mext file for my Weather+ Extension on mBlock.

You can download it and open it in
https://ext.mblock.cc/

You can edit the code there. (Don't steal my API key :D).
The code is in async JavaScript syntax, which is a bit complicated...


For more of a tutorial about uploading this extension to mBlock, see my other extension:

Thanks for viewing!
